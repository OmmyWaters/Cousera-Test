 <h1>Hello Coursera... It's a great course</h1>
 <p>Coming back to learn this coding is really an eye opener for me. I dont even know why i abandoned this course in the first place</p>
 <p>From now on, I'm going to take these courses more seriously and see what i can do about it in the next six or seven months to come. I'm really enjoying it. I'll also have to practice more in order to increase my skills and get better at coding</p>
 <p>Ive just learned how to use browser-sync</p>
